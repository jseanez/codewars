// function switchItUp(number){
// //Write your own Code!
// }
// When provided with a number between 0-9, return it in words.

// Input :: 1

// Output :: "One".

// If your language supports it, try using a switch statement.

// The input number will always be between 0 and 9 and be a single number. I want to return that number in written out form as a string.

// The only way right now I can think of solving this is switch case or a long if else statement
